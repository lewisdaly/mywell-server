**Abstract:**

### Old one:

Citizen science is when everyday citizens are involved in scientific study. Citizen science allows professionals to harness a large of resources, and amateurs the opportunity to contribute to science. Crowdsourcing, or obtaining information from the general public can be a method of citizen science (Howe, 2006). The growth of mobile networks and the ubiquity of mobile phones in low income countries (Pew, 2014) has created an opportunity for innovation around crowdsourced citizen science to solve practical problems.

MyWell is a smartphone and SMS application for crowdsourcing groundwater, rainfall, water quality and checkdam water levels in rural India. Groundwater depletion is a serious issue for farmers and villagers who rely on groundwater for their livelihoods. MyWell crowdsources well information from villagers, and aims to improve the situation, both through information collection, and building community involvement and citizen ‘buy-in’.

**Extended Abstract**

## Background

India uses the largest amount of groundwater in the world, estimated at 230 cubic kilometers per year (World Bank, 2010). A relatively cheap and accessible resource, groundwater suffers from the tradgedy of the commons. Groundwater is often overexploited for food production, with rainfall insufficient to recharge the groundwater levels (Rathore, 2004).

Groundwater is fundamental to the livelihoods of many farmers across India. In rural India, over 60 percent of agriculture is dependent on groundwater irrigation (World Bank, 2010). Groundwater allows farmers to grow crops in the dry season, as well as manage deficiencies in monsoonal rainfall, contributing to improved livelihoods and poverty alleviation (Maheshwari et al, 2014).

To ensure the future livelyhoods of these farmers, intervention is required. Many existing intervention approaches are top-down; policy makers and researchers with a clear view of watershed-level issues instruct farmers to use less water. With these approaches, farmers are often left out of the conversation, and aren't able to engage in groundwater management. MyWell, within the scope of a larger project MARVI - Managed Aquifer Recharge for Village level Intervention - set out to build participatory approaches for groundwater management from the bottom, the farmers and villages themselves.


## MyWell

MyWell is a smartphone and SMS application for crowdsourcing groundwater, rainfall, water quality and checkdam water levels in rural India. Farmers armed with a smartphone or feature phone can glean insights into the groundwater situation, and participate in a network of connected farmers who gather and access a shared pool of data.

__TODO- which one?__

MyWell is an application for data-driven insights of groundwater at the village level. MyWell crowdsources well level indicators from a group of connected farmers using SMS or a smartphone application.


MyWell's primary purpose tool for giving ownership of the groundwater situation to farmers at the village level, and assist them in developing their own solutions...

Before MyWell, farmers in these parts of India made decisions based on a whim. With MyWell, farmers are empowered with insights from groundwater data and stuff.

MyWell is a platform for building groundwater cooperatives - communities of villages brought together by the need to manage this scarce resource fairly.

MyWell was deployed within project MARVI, a transdisciplinary approach to groundwater management. __TODO - talk about limits of technology__

## Impact
MyWell has the potential to impact the livelyhoods of farmers across ____ areas.

We see the greatest potential in MyWell for empowering smallholder farmers to be actively invoved in science through data collection, and to be a part of the solution to groundwater scarcity.

MyWell also allows farmers to make data-driven decisions about using groundwater. From a resource allocation perspective, these communities will allow for short-term better allocation of water (ie. so crops won't fail). Long term, ... steps towards ensuring the future livelyhoods of farmers.

MyWell is a tool for helping build communities around the need to share groundwater. While not a solution in and of itself, we see MyWell as an instrument that can be used to facilitate conversations about groundwater,...



## Results

This case study evaluates MyWell's implementation in 2 watersheds in rural west India. We demonstrate that MyWell can be used at multiple levels to enable data-driven farming at multiple levels of a "value chain", specifically for abetter groundwater understanding to smallholder farmers. We also demonstrate how MyWell empowers low level stakeholders to be a part of citizen science, and actively involved in a solution to the groundwater problem.


## Future

Beyond groundwater, the MyWell approach also has potential to impact other aspects of ___ in resource-scarce environments.

We see MyWell as a platform for sharing water knowledge, and allow for grassroots citizen science to take place. The typical narrative of groundwater conservation is a top down approach; well informed research leads to recommendations to farmers to use less groundwater; advice that often goes unheeded. The MyWell approach is the opposite. MyWell allows for farmers to engage in science, and see for themselves the groundwater scarcity problem. This allows them to make their own decisions to share groundwater, and combats the tradgedy of the commons.

While this study evaluates MyWell's use in 2 watersheds in rural India, MyWell is not limited to these places, or even India. Future research should apply MyWell to other countries and groundwater situations...

MyWell also has considerable network effects; the more wells being monitored with this technology, the more valuable the information gathered is, and the more insights for data-driven action it can deliver across multiple stakeholder levels.

We also would see MyWell integrate with existing tools to allow for more researchers. We are currently planning an integration with CGMN... This increases the utility of MyWell for other groundwater researchers...
