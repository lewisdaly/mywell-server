### (What are the technical details behind how your innovation works? Or describe how your process makes things more effective.)
MyWell is a Smartphone and SMS app for tracking wells in MARVI. The app works by crowdsourcing well, rainfall and checkdam readings from MARVI's network of BJs. MyWell displays the current status of each well, as well as historical and village level data for simple comparison and analysis.


- volunteers on the ground are responsible for a number of wells
- each week, they record a well reading, and upload to MyWell
- Upload over SMS for feature phones, or the MyWell App.

Network of farmers can then use app to get updates on their well, see the village's average reading, and compare their well's status with the last 2 years.
