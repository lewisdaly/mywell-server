##Using MyWell

- What is it
  - Application for Smartphone & SMS for recording and tracking well readings
  - BJ's can submit well readings using the MyWell App on android, or by submitting over SMS
- How to use:
  - BJ's travel around to wells, taking readings (this is currently being done on paper)
  - Upload reading using SMS or app: (show example)
  - Populates the map, and graphs etc.
  - Also have the ability to track Rainfall levels and Checkdams (little dams)
  - BJ's can also add new 'resources', by inputting a few details, such as LatLng,
  - Attach pictures for a well
  - View graphs and statistics
  - Also support excel uploading for desktop...


##What is it

MyWell is a Smartphone and SMS app for tracking wells in MARVI. This app works by crowdsourcing well, rainfall and checkdam readings from MARVI's network of BJs. Through simple data visualisations, MyWell allows farmers to see the current status of their well, and their village's wells, and easily compare against the last 2 years of data.

##How it works

###Readings & Visualisation
Whenever a BJ takes a reading of a well, rainfall station or checkdam, they can use submit it immediately using MyWell. By simply taking out their smartphone, or over SMS, all they need to do is fill in a simple form. This eliminates the need to use paper based systems, and also allows for immediate feedback for the farmers relying on the readings. Once a reading is saved in the MyWell system, it can be accessed at a later date for statistics and data analysis.

With a network of BJs collecting data, MyWell is able to provide insight and ___ to farmers. MyWell displays easy-to-understand graphs which snapshot the readings from a Well, Raingauge or Checkdam, and compare them against readings over the last 3 years. MyWell also calculates the average watertable depth for a village, so farmers monitoring their own well can benchmark against the other farmers in their village.

###Management
In addition to crowdsourcing reading data, MyWell allows for a network of BJs and Administrators to manage the MyWell system. With MyWell, BJs and administrators of the MyWell system can register a new Well, Rainfall Station or Checkdam - even using their device's inbuilt GPS to pinpoint the location. MyWell also allows for BJs to attach a 'banner image' for each well allowing for greater personalisation and buy-in from farmers. In addition, MyWell allows administrators to upload a large number of readings at a time, allowing an import of large amounts of historical data, which increases the immediate value of MyWell to the farmers.



##The Future
- Finding other ways for people to interact (improve SMS features)
- More scalability (& better user management)
