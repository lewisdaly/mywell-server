Farmers across many semi-arid parts of India reply on groundwater as a primary water source. As water becomes increasingly scarce, new methods for conserving and monitoring groundwater are required. MyWell is an app for tracking and visualising water and rainfall levels, aiming to engage farmers in new conservation methods.

In this presentation, we will look how MyWell was implemented, and what it hopes to achieve. We will also discuss how IT and crowdsourcing can be used as an effective tool for development in low income countries.
